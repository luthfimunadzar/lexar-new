			"faq1Question1": "What is the difference between a local company and a foreign investment company?",
			"faq1Answer1": `
				<p>A local company or a domestic investment company is a limited liability company whose shareholders are entirely <b>Indonesian entities</b> (Indonesian citizens or legal entities), whereas a foreign investment company is a limited liability company with shares owned by a foreign entity (foreign citizens or legal entities).</p>
			`,
			"faq1Question2": "What are the requirements to establish a domestic investment company?",
			"faq1Answer2": `
				<p>A local company must be established by at least 2 Shareholders that may also become the company’s Management (Director or Commissioner) having at least Rp. 51.000.000, - of paid up capital (Small Scale). </p>
				<p>Local companies may operate in any—but not all—areas of business. </p>
				<p>The documents that are needed to establish a local company are the founders’ identity card (KTP), certificate of family registration (KK), and taxpayer number (NPWP), as well as their phone number and email. We may have to request additional documents if required.</p>
			`,
			"faq1Question3": "What are the requirements to establish a foreign investment company?",
			"faq1Answer3": `
				<p>A foreign investment company must be established by at least 2 Shareholders that may also become the company’s Management (Director or Commissioner) having at least Rp.2.500.000.000,- of paid up capital.</p>

We may have to request additional documents if required.</p>
			`,
			"faq1Question4": "What is the procedure to select a name for a company?",
			"faq1Answer4": `
				<p>The name of a local company must incorporate at least 3 words and in Bahasa Indonesia. The name of foreign investment companies must also be in 3 words, but may be in a foreign language. </p>
			`,
			"faq1Question5": "How are issued shares calculated?",
			"faq1Answer5": `
				<p>The number of shares issued is the amount of paid-up capital, and you also have to determine the nominal value of each share.</p>

				<p>Formula:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Paid-up capital : nominal value of shares = number of company’s shares</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Number of company’s shares × percentage of shares owned = number of shares owned by shareholders</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Number of shares owned x nominal value of shares = amount that must be paid-up in the company</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Example:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							If you wish to establish a limited liability company with:<br/>
							paid-up capital of Rp. 51.000.000, -<br/>
							then the authorized capital is 4 × Rp. 51.000.000, - = Rp. 204.000.000, -						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							To calculate the number of shares issued, consider the following example:<br/>
							A & B establishes PT ALFA BRAVO CHARLIE (“PT ABC”)<br/>
							Authorized capital = Rp. 204.000.000, - <br/>
							Paid-up capital = Rp. 51.000.000, -<br/>
							Nominal value of one share agreed by the founders = Rp. 10.000, -<br/>
							The number of shares in the company is 5.100<br/>
							Then A & B holds 50% of the shares in PT ABC, with each holding 2.550 based on the following calculation:<br/>
							A = 51.000.000: 10.000 = 5.100 x 50% = 2.550 shares, then A must store Rp. 25.500.000, - to the company’s account<br/>
							B = 51.000.000: 10.000 = 5.100 x 50% = 2.550 shares, then B must store Rp. 25.500.000, - to the company’s account
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			`,
			"faq1Question6": "Is it possible to withdraw money that has been paid up to an account?",
			"faq1Answer6": `
				<p>Yes. The money transferred to the company’s account is the paid-up capital in the company. This amount may be withdrew for the operations of the company, as long as such withdrawal is represented in the company’s books.</p>
			`,
			"faq1Question7": "How is the ‘purpose and objectives’ in a deed of establishment decided?",
			"faq1Answer7": `
				<p>The ‘purpose and objectives’ in a company’s deed of establishment must be determined according to the Indonesian 2017 Standard Industrial Classification <a href="http://spkonline.bps.go.id/spkonline" target="_blank">KBLI 2017</a> issued by the government. Identify the business activities that your company intends to do, then check the KBLI 2017 based on the code, name, or explanation of the business activities. If you find that there is no industrial classification that suits your company’s business activities, select one that is most closely related. It is not possible to establish a company for “general” commerce or services, and your company’s business activities must be specifically stated in the deed of establishment.</p>
			`,
			"faq1Question8": "What are the documents needed to incorporate a company?",
			"faq1Answer8": `
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>For Indonesian citizens: identity card (KTP), certificate of family registration (KK), and taxpayer number (NPWP)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>For foreign citizens: valid passport</p>

			"faq1Question9": "How is the taxpayer number of a newly established company administered at the tax office?",
			"faq1Answer9": `
				<p>

			"faq1Question10": "Why are licenses such as the SKDP, SIUP, and TDP not granted by the government anymore?",
			"faq1Answer10": `
				<p>The government intends to provide more ease of doing business by establishing the Online Single Submission (OSS) system, an integrated system that aims to accommodate applications for business license across different sectors and government authorities. As such, according to the Announcement of the Investment Coordination Board (BKPM) and provincial investment services offices (DPMPTSP Pemprov) concerning the Integration of Services for Trade Licenses (SIUP) and Company Registration Certificate (TDP), the government has adopted terms in which: </p>
